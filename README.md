# nixos-m1

This is an apple silicon version of https://github.com/JaKooLit/NixOS-Hyprland.

Feel free to use it, it is fully compatible with their https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots repo.

Not everything is exactly the same, and I am still tweaking it, but it builds and works on a 2020 m1 macbook air with 8GB of ram.

May require some tweaking on your end for your liking.
